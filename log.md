# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Starting `100 Days of Code`, set up environment and repositories.

**Thoughts:** I finally made the switch from Windows to Linux and decided one of the first things I want to start with this challenge is to learn [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), as I've always been quite curious on building mobile applications. I forked the challenge and also created a repository for a basic Flutter application. ðŸš€

**Link(s) to work:** 
1. [Flutter App](http://github.com/theunisbotha/flutterapp)
