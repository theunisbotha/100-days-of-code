# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 11 August, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Starting `100 Days of Code`, set up environment and repositories.

**Thoughts:** I finally made the switch from Windows to Linux and decided one of the first things I want to start with this challenge is to learn [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), as I've always been quite curious on building mobile applications. I forked the challenge and also created a repository for a basic Flutter application. üöÄ

### Day 1: 12 August, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I set up a physical device and finished the first part of the Flutter tutorial. I learned the basics of Stateless and Statefull widgets and how they interact.

**Thoughts:** Decided to set up my physical device instead of an emulator, and I was blown away at how easy it was. Simply installed the `adb` package using my terminal, connected my mobile device and turned on `USB Debugging`, authorized it, ran `adb devices` and it was connected. I simply switched back to VS Code and was able to debug on my device.

I was a bit overwhelmed before and had a bit of a difficult time grasping the concepts of Flutter, but actually spending time going through the tutorial helped me understand how it fits together. 

All in all, so far this challenge proves that starting is difficult, but as soon as you do, continuing is easy. üëè

### Day 2: 13 August, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learned about Flutter's Navigation stack and state changing by finishing the tutorial for the first app. Ran the release and installed on my physical device.

**Thoughts:** I learned more about the Navigation stack in Flutter and how it basically functions, it was quite easy to grasp the concept after implementing it. I like the additional feature of a `back` button being automatically added to the appbar to pop the current stack.

After finishing the tutorial, I was curious on how to change the icon for the application, so I continued playing around with that until I was happy. I finished by running a release to see how difficult it is, and to my surprise, one simple command did the trick (well, for this very basic application).

### Day 3: 14 August, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started experimenting and attempted to access local images on the device by using the `local_image_provider` package by [csdcorp](https://github.com/csdcorp/local_image_provider). Managed to just implement the example usage and get the ID of the latest images.

**Thoughts:** Without Flutter holding my hand, I'm now over to scouring the Internet and experimenting to build a basic local image viewing application. I am planning on uising the package to read a list of images from the device and attempting to display them in a grid like your device's *Gallery* application would.
